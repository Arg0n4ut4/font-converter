# Contributing

This was a quick project created solely to meet a need I have at my current job; it may also be useful to you. Due to the project's urgency I did not test on clean virtual machines, and I ultimately decided to drop thread synchronization and progress feedback. Those additions introduced many bugs that I do not have time to fix, so I reverted to a simple but working version.

If you want to add something, fix a bug that appears, or investigate an issue that occurs on different machines, feel free to submit a pull request. I do not guarantee that I will review it promptly, as I will not be giving this project much attention.

I use this tool in my daily work, so if Google Fonts naming conventions change or I encounter unique cases, I may update TTF recognition and WOFF2 naming logic for better robustness. For now it appears to work adequately.
